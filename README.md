# proj4-maps
This program utilizes the leaflet.js library and the MapQuest reverse geocoding API to provide the user with map page focuses on the Eugene, OR area.

This page, mappingpage.html, allows the user to navigate around the Eugene area. When the user clicks a point on the map, a pointer is set at that point with a label that displays the address for that location.
